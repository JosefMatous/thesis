    abstract = {This paper presents a viable approach for incorporating collision avoidance strategies into existing guidance and control systems on marine vessels. We propose a method that facilitates the use of simulation-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) for collision avoidance (COLAV) on marine vessels. Any COLAV strategy to be applied in real traffic must adhere to the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea (COLREGS). The proposed MPC COLAV method does not rely on an accurate model of the guidance system to achieve vessel behaviors that are compliant with the COLREGS. Rather, it depends on transitional costs in the MPC objective for collision avoidance maneuvers that are being executed by the marine vessel. Hence, it is straightforward to implement the MPC COLAV on different vessels without specific knowledge of the vessel's guidance strategy. Moreover, it offers the possibility to switch between different (possibly application specific) guidance strategies on the same vessel while running the same MPC COLAV algorithm. We present results from full scale experiments that show the viability of our method in different collision avoidance scenarios.},

Additionally, the human cognitive abilities and the collision avoidance regulations (COLREGs) for ship navigation are examined together with water based collision avoidance algorithms. The requirements for autonomous ship navigation are addressed in conjunction with the factors influencing ship collision avoidance. Humans are able to appreciate these factors and also perform ship navigation at a satisfactory level, but their critical decisions are highly subjective and can lead to error and potentially, to ship collision. The research for autonomous ship navigation may be grouped into the classical and soft computing based categories. Classical techniques are based on mathematical models and algorithms while soft-computing techniques are based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). The areas of AI for autonomous ship collision avoidance are examined in this paper are evolutionary algorithms, fuzzy logic, expert systems, and neural networks (NN), as well as a combination of them (hybrid system).},

This paper presents a unified framework for safety-critical control of ASVs for maneuvering, dynamic positioning, and control allocation with safety guarantees in the presence of unknown ocean currents. The framework utilizes control Lyapunov function (CLF)- and control barrier function (CBF)-based quadratic programs (QPs), and is applicable to a general class of nonlinear affine control systems. The stabilization objective is formulated as a maneuvering problem and integral action is introduced in the CLFs to counteract the effect of unknown irrotational ocean currents. Furthermore, ocean current estimates are constructed for robust CBF design, and analytic conditions under which the estimates guarantee safety are derived. Subsequently, robust CBFs are designed to achieve collision avoidance of static obstacles. The paper concludes by verifying the framework in simulation for a double-ended passenger ferry.},

The result is demonstrated on adaptive cruise control, which presents both safety and performance considerations, as well as actuator bounds. We begin by presenting a novel notion of a barrier function associated with a set, formulated in the context of Lyapunov-like conditions; the existence of a barrier function satisfying these conditions implies forward invariance of the set. This formulation naturally yields a notion of control barrier function (CBF), yielding inequality constraints in the control input that, when satisfied, again imply forward invariance of the set. Through these constructions, CBFs can naturally be unified with control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) in the context of a quadratic program (QP); this allows for the simultaneous achievement of control objectives (represented by CLFs) subject to conditions on the admissible states of the system (represented by CBFs). These formulations are illustrated in the context of adaptive cruise control, where the control objective of achieving a desired speed is balanced by the minimum following conditions on a lead car and force-based constraints on acceleration and braking.},

    abstract = {This paper presents an autonomous motion planning algorithm for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to navigate safely in dynamic, cluttered environments. The algorithm not only addresses hazard avoidance (HA) for stationary and moving hazards, but also applies the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (known as COLREGS, for COLlision REGulationS). The COLREGS rules specify, for example, which vessel is responsible for giving way to the other and to which side of the “stand-on” vessel to maneuver. Three primary COLREGS rules are considered in this paper: crossing, overtaking, and head-on situations. For autonomous USVs to be safely deployed in environments with other traffic boats, it is imperative that the USV's navigation algorithm obeys COLREGS. Furthermore, when other boats disregard their responsibility under COLREGS, the USV must fall back to its HA algorithms to prevent a collision. The proposed approach is based on velocity obstacles (VO) method, which generates a cone-shaped obstacle in the velocity space. Because VOs also specify on which side of the obstacle the vehicle will pass during the avoidance maneuver, COLREGS are encoded in the velocity space in a natural way. Results from several experiments involving up to four vessels are presented, in what we believe is the first on-water demonstration of autonomous COLREGS maneuvers without explicit intervehicle communication. We also show an application of this motion planner to a target trailing task, where a strategic planner commands USV waypoints based on high-level objectives, and the local motion planner ensures hazard avoidance and compliance with COLREGS during a traverse.},

The paper describes a method that is based on finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC). A finite control set is generated by more practical control commands: the thruster speed and propulsion angle of the USV. The method is conceptually and computationally simple and yet quite versatile, as it can account for the dynamics of the USV, steering and propulsion system. Based on the theory of FCS-MPC, a safe and fast CAS is proposed, and it is verified in different static and dynamic environments. The real environment model for collision avoidance is established by extracting the environment data from the electronic chart. The result shows that the method is effective and can control the USV to sail safely and quickly in complex real scenarios with multiple dynamic obstacles.},

However, UAVs where these formation control algorithms are applied have not the ability to avoid collisions. Decentralized model predictive control (MPC) is applied to generate control inputs for formation flying with collision-avoidance capability. Using decentralized MPC, each UAV plans only its own action to track the trajectory specified by the formation control algorithm within the feasible regions satisfying collision-avoidance. The authors show how the optimization problems with coupled constraints such as collision-avoidance can be solved by each decoupled UAV in parallel with the other UAVs so that the decisions independently taken by each UAV can ensure consistency in coupled constraints of collision-avoidance. The computation time is also taken into account because it is a crucial factor to apply MPC to actual UAVs. Finally, the proposed approach is validated by some simulations.},

As a result, a compatibility constraint is required to ensure the consistency between each agent׳s real operation and its plan and to establish the agreement among agents.
