This chapter presents some of the background theory that is used in the thesis.
The theory presented here is relevant to multiple chapters throughout the thesis.
In Section~\ref{sec:model}, we present a control-oriented model of marine vehicles.
Section~\ref{sec:background_paths} presents the theory behind paths, that is then used in Section~\ref{sec:background_formation_path_following} to define the formation path-following problem.
In Section~\ref{sec:background_LOS}, we then present the line-of-sight guidance algorithm as a method for solving the path-following problem.
