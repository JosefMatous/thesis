\section{Null Space Behavioral Algorithm}
\label{sec:background_NSB}

This section describes the \gls{nsb} algorithm.
The \gls{nsb} algorithm is a method that allows us to combine several tasks in a hierarchic manner.
The algorithm was originally developed for first-order systems
\begin{equation}
    \dot{\mat{p}} = \mat{v},
\end{equation}
where $\mat{p} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ are the generalized coordinates, and $\mat{v} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ are the control inputs.

In \gls{nsb} algorithms, the desired behavior of the system is divided into several tasks.
Let there be $m$ tasks, arranged by priority in a descending order (\emph{i.e.,} task 1 has the highest priority, task $m$ has the lowest priority).
Let $\bs{\sigma}_1, \ldots, \bs{\sigma}_m$ denote the so-called \emph{task variables}.
Each variable is a function of the system coordinates, \emph{i.e.,}
\begin{align}
    \bs{\sigma}_i &= f_i(\mat{p}), &
    f_i &: \mathbb{R}^N \mapsto \mathbb{R}^{n_i},
\end{align}
where $n_i \leq N$ is the dimensionality of task $i$.
Applying the chain rule, the time-derivative of $\bs{\sigma}_i$ is
\begin{equation}
    \dot{\bs{\sigma}}_i = \frac{\partial f_i(\mat{p})}{\partial \mat{p}} \mat{v} \triangleq \mat{J}_i(\mat{p}) \mat{v}.
\end{equation}
Let $\dot{\bs{\sigma}}_i^{*}$ be the desired closed-loop behavior of the task variable\footnote{
In many applications, the task variable should track some pre-defined desired value, $\bs{\sigma}_{d, i}$.
In such cases, we typically choose the following desired closed-loop behavior
$
    \dot{\bs{\sigma}}_i^{*} = \dot{\bs{\sigma}}_{d, i} - \bs{\Lambda}_i \left(\bs{\sigma}_i - \bs{\sigma}_{d,i}\right),    
$
where $\bs{\Lambda}_i$ is a positive definite gain matrix.
}.
Then, the smallest input (in terms of Euclidean norm) that guarantees the desired behavior is
\begin{equation}
    \mat{v}_i = \mat{J}_i^{\dagger} \dot{\bs{\sigma}}_i^{*},
    \label{eq:background_NSB_velocity_i}
\end{equation}
where $\mat{J}_i^{\dagger}$ is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the task Jacobian.

If the task is \emph{redundant}, \emph{i.e.}, if $n_i < N$, then there exists a subspace of control inputs that do not interfere with the task.
Let $\mat{v}_{\rm add}$ be an additional input.
Then, the following control input
\begin{equation}
    \mat{v} = \mat{v}_i + \mat{N}_i \mat{v}_{\rm add},
\end{equation}
where $\mat{N}_i = \mat{I}_{N} - \mat{J}_i^{\dagger}\mat{J}_i$ is the null space projector of $\mat{J}_i$, guarantees the desired behavior of the task.
The additional control input is satisfied only if it does not interfere with the task.

In the \gls{nsb} algorithm, the control inputs from the individual tasks are composed by projecting the inputs from the lower-priority tasks onto the null space of the higher-priority tasks.
In the literature, there exist two variants of the algorithm.
The first variant calculates the control input $\mat{v}$ using the following equation
\begin{align}
    \mat{v} &= \mat{v}_{1} + \mat{N}_1 \biggl(\mat{v}_{2} + \mat{N}_2\Bigl(\mat{v}_3 \cdots + \mat{N}_{m-2}\bigl(\mat{v}_{m-1} + \mat{N}_{m-1}\mat{v}_m\bigr)\Bigr)\biggr),
\end{align}
with $\mat{v}_i$ given by \eqref{eq:background_NSB_velocity_i}.

The second variant uses the so-called \emph{augmented} Jacobians
\begin{align}
    \Bar{\mat{J}}_i &= \inlinevector{\mat{J}_1\T, \ldots, \mat{J}_i\T}.
\end{align}
Let $\Bar{\mat{N}}_i$ denote the null space projector of $\Bar{\mat{J}}_i$.
Then, the control input $\mat{v}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    \mat{v} = \mat{v}_1 + \sum_{i=2}^m \Bar{\mat{N}}_{i-1} \mat{v}_i.
\end{equation}
The advantages and disadvantages of both approaches are discussed in \cite{antonelli_stability_2008}.
In the thesis, we will mostly use the first variant.

\subsection{Independence and orthogonality}
The concepts of independence and orthogonality are important when analyzing the interactions between the tasks.
Specifically, these concepts determine whether the tasks can be executed simultaneously, and how the null space projector affects the lower-priority tasks.

Two tasks are \emph{independent} if the pseudoinverses of their Jacobians are linearly independent.
Let $\mat{J}_i$ and $\mat{J}_j$ denote the Jacobians of task $i$ and $j$, respectively.
These tasks are independent if
\begin{equation}
    {\rank} \left(\mat{J}_i^{\dagger}\right) + {\rank} \left(\mat{J}_j^{\dagger}\right) = {\rm rank} \left(\left[ \mat{J}_i^{\dagger},\, \mat{J}_j^{\dagger} \right]\right),
    \label{eq:background_independence_pseudo}
\end{equation}
Antonelli \emph{et al.} \cite{antonelli_stability_2008} remark that the pseudoinverse and the transpose of the task Jacobian share the same span.
Consequently, the condition in \eqref{eq:background_independence_pseudo} is equivalent to
\begin{equation}
    {\rank} \left(\mat{J}_i\T\right) + {\rank} \left(\mat{J}_j\T\right) = {\rm rank} \left(\left[ \mat{J}_i\T,\, \mat{J}_j\T \right]\right).
    \label{eq:background_independence}
\end{equation}

Two tasks are \emph{orthogonal} if the subspaces spanned by these tasks are orthogonal, \emph{i.e.,} if
\begin{equation}
    \mat{J}_i \, \mat{J}_j^{\dagger} = \mat{O}_{n_i \times n_j},
\end{equation}
where $\mat{O}_{n_i \times n_j}$ is an $n_i$-by-$n_j$ null matrix.

Now, let us consider two consecutive tasks that are independent and orthogonal. 
Without loss of generality, let us denote these tasks $1$ and $2$.
The control input produced by combining these two tasks is
\begin{equation}
    \mat{v} = \mat{J}_1^{\dagger} \dot{\bs{\sigma}}_1^{*} + \mat{N}_1 \mat{J}_2^{\dagger} \dot{\bs{\sigma}}_2^{*}
    = \mat{J}_1^{\dagger} \dot{\bs{\sigma}}_1^{*} + \left(\mat{I} - \mat{J}_1^{\dagger}\mat{J}_1\right) \mat{J}_2^{\dagger} \dot{\bs{\sigma}}_2^{*}
    = \mat{J}_1^{\dagger} \dot{\bs{\sigma}}_1^{*} + \mat{J}_2^{\dagger} \dot{\bs{\sigma}}_2^{*}.
\end{equation}

We have thus shown that if two consecutive tasks are independent and orthogonal, they can be executed simultaneously.
Moreover, the null-space projector does not affect the lower-priority task.

\subsection{\gls{nsb} algorithm for the formation path-following problem}
In the remainder of the section, we demonstrate how the \gls{nsb} algorithm can be used to solve the formation path-following problem.

Let $\mat{p}\T = \left[\mat{p}_1\T, \ldots, \mat{p}_n\T\right]$ be the concatenated position vector of $n$ vehicles.
To solve the problem, we define two tasks: formation-keeping and path-following.
The formation-keeping task has the highest priority.
The task variable, $\bs{\sigma}_1$, is given by
\begin{align}
    \bs{\sigma}_1 &= \inlinevector{\bs{\sigma}_{1, 1}\T, \bs{\sigma}_{1, 2}\T, \ldots, \bs{\sigma}_{1, n-1}\T}, &
    \bs{\sigma}_{1, i} &= \mat{p}_i - \mat{p}_b,
    \label{eq:background_formation_variable}
\end{align}
where $\mat{p}_b = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \mat{p}_i$ is the barycenter of the formation (see Section~\ref{sec:background_formation_path_following}).

\begin{rmk}
    The formation-keeping task contains the relative positions of the first $n-1$ vehicles.
    The relative position of the last vehicle is omitted, because it can be expressed as a linear combination of the remaining relative positions.
    Indeed, from \eqref{eq:background_formation_variable}, we get
    \begin{equation}
        \bs{\sigma}_{1, n} = \mat{p}_n - \mat{p}_b = - \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \bs{\sigma}_{1, i}.
    \end{equation}
    By omitting the last relative position vector, the task Jacobian is full column rank.
    Indeed, the Jacobian of the formation-keeping task is
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
            \mat{J}_1 &= 
            \begin{bmatrix}
                \frac{N-1}{N} \mat{I}_3 & -\frac{1}{N} \mat{I}_3 & \cdots & -\frac{1}{N} \mat{I}_3 & -\frac{1}{N} \mat{I}_3 \\[3pt]
                -\frac{1}{N} \mat{I}_3 & \frac{N-1}{N} \mat{I}_3 & & -\frac{1}{N} \mat{I}_3 & -\frac{1}{N} \mat{I}_3 \\ 
                \vdots & & \ddots & & \vdots \\
                -\frac{1}{N} \mat{I}_3 & -\frac{1}{N} \mat{I}_3 & \cdots & \frac{N-1}{N} \mat{I}_3 & -\frac{1}{N} \mat{I}_3
            \end{bmatrix} \\[6pt]
            &= \left[\mat{I}_{3(n-1)},\, \mat{O}_{3(n-1) \times 3}\right] - \frac{1}{N} \mat{1}_{(n-1) \times n} \otimes \mat{I}_3.
        \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    One can verify that the rank of $\mat{J}_1$ is $3(n-1)$, and the Jacobian is thus full column rank.
\end{rmk}

The desired value of the formation-keeping task variable is
\begin{align}
    \bs{\sigma}_{d, 1} &= \inlinevector{\mat{p}_{f, 1}\T, \mat{p}_{f, 2}\T, \ldots, \mat{p}_{f, n-1}\T},
\end{align}
where $\mat{p}_{f, i}$ is the desired position of vehicle $i$ within the formation (see Section~\ref{sec:background_formation_path_following}).

The formation-keeping control input $\mat{v}_1$ is then given by
\begin{equation}
    \mat{v}_1 = \mat{J}_1^{\dagger} \left(\dot{\bs{\sigma}}_{d, 1} - \bs{\Lambda}_1 (\bs{\sigma}_1 - \bs{\sigma}_{d, 1})\right),
\end{equation}
where $\bs{\Lambda}_1$ is a positive definite gain matrix.
